        <P> 
        <P> In years gone by Casino Online operators could afford to have a "build it 
          and they will come" attitude. That's not the case anymore. The design 
          of a successful Casino Online begins with an understanding of where the money 
          comes from-the customer. When players had few choices, marketing was 
          simple. Let the gamblers know where to find you, offer them a few incentives 
          and they showed up. These days it's not so easy. Most people in North 
          America live within a day's drive of one or more gaming areas. Most 
          of those gaming areas have multiple Casino Onlines. Marketing has become a 
          tough, competitive business. Accordingly, a Casino Online should be designed 
          from the ground up to support that marketing. There are different ways 
          to look at potential markets. You might classify players as grind, middle 
          or premium.</P>
        <P> You might also identify local, traveler or destination markets. What 
          it boils down to is understanding how much your customers will spend 
          and how far they have to travel to reach the Casino Online. Other significant 
          niche markets include Asian or Middle-Eastern players. The geographic 
          location of a Casino Online is a huge consideration. A hard look at demographics 
          and travel patterns is well worth the time. How much competition is 
          nearby? And what kinds of customers do they specialize in? How affluent 
          are people in potential target markets? Who already visits the area? 
          Who might be lured away from another gaming area? A destination resort 
          needs to be someplace a destination traveler will actually want to spend 
          time. Politicians frequently imagine they can solve tax problems by 
          building destination resorts in run down inner-cities. In those surroundings 
          a more realistic approach would be to expect the bulk of the customers 
          to live nearby. Accordingly the design of the Casino Online should reflect 
          the expected customers. The holy grail of the Casino Online industry is that 
          elite group of players known as high-rollers. These players can choose 
          from any gaming destination in the world. They expect personal service, 
          a luxury hotel and first-class amenities. Because high-rollers are so 
          coveted, most Casino Onlines find problems competing in this market. A Casino Online 
          operator should commit to a market segment. Casino Onlines that try to be "all 
          things to all people" usually miss the mark. There are many examples 
          of this. Luxurious facilities are intermixed with less lavish offerings 
          like value-priced buffets or video arcades. The result is confusion 
          for the customer. Those with less money don't feel they belong in the 
          opulently-styled buildings. At the same time, wealthy players think 
          the operation looks tacky. All too often the result is an empty Casino Online. 
          Gaming is fundamentally a form of entertainment. </P>
        <P>With that in mind, Casino Online theming is a basic consideration. What kind 
          of imagery or non-gaming attractions will appeal to the target market? 
          The most successful Casino Onlines have chosen an identity and run with it. 
          There is no magic formula. The carnival theme (with acrobats flying 
          overhead) has worked for Circus Circus. A live action pirate show put 
          Treasure Island on the map. And now, Las Vegas heavy-weight Steve Wynn 
          is betting the understated elegance of an Italian villa will do the 
          trick at his new Bellagio. Those are successes. Failed operations have 
          often spent big bucks on amenities that on one wanted. There's a limit 
          to how many people want to ride rollercoasters. Support facilities can 
          make or break a Casino Online. Customers will base their opinions on the entire 
          experience-not just the gambling. Sometimes it's the shopping or the 
          golf or the health spa that makes the difference. Research into the 
          tastes of the target market is a good starting place for decision making 
          about the support facilities. When it comes to designing a hotel tower, 
          more is better. The farther a player has to travel from his home to 
          your Casino Online, the more he's likely to gamble. The more rooms a Casino Online 
          has, the more premium players it can afford to keep on the property. 
          The experience in every destination gaming area is that revenues only 
          go up when the number of rooms goes up. Parking is an easily overlooked 
          amenity. There's nothing particularly glamorous about parking. Parking 
          garages are expensive to build, and they don't even look impressive 
          in architects' renderings. Yet, for North American Casino Onlines the parking 
          (or lack of it) can be make all the difference in the world. Players 
          who have driven to a gaming area often stick close to wherever their 
          car is. Once you have targeted a market segment and chosen a theme it 
          gets down to the nuts-and-bolts of designing the physical building. 
          This takes an understanding of how people move about Casino Online facilities 
          and how the operations actually work. Since not all customers will be 
          on the Casino Online floor at the same time (some will be in the restaurants, 
          show lounges, bars, their rooms) it is the total number of guests in 
          the complex which represents the true potential of the Casino Online. In one 
          Casino Online an escalator system was designed to carry players from the restaurant 
          right out the exit doors rather than deliver them to the gaming floor. 
          In another Casino Online, concrete floors were put down without providing alleyways 
          for electrical wires and cables. In still another facility, room service 
          had to push food carts through the main Casino Online because the service elevators 
          were on the opposite side of the building from the kitchen. The layout 
          of a Casino Online floor is a subjective matter. It has to be inviting, but 
          how do you accomplish that? A complex maze of slot machines can create 
          a sense of adventure as players walk through. On the other hand, the 
          same machines in a slightly different layout might look cluttered and 
          cause a sense of disorientation. The mix of games is forever changing 
          in every Casino Online. But, an operator needs to know where to start. The 
          type of players in the target market determines the basic ratio between 
          table games and slot machines (actually, the current jargon term is 
          Electronic Gaming Devices, or EGD's, which includes video poker, video 
          keno & mulitplay machines, as well as traditional slot machines). Low 
          end players are more likely to favor slots. As players have more money, 
          they're more inclined towards table games. Within table games there 
          are niche segments to consider. Baccarat is a favorite game of the true 
          high-rollers. Some Asian players prefer Pai Gow Poker which is almost 
          unknown to most players. On the slot side, there are more options than 
          ever, with new companies appearing all the time, and established firms 
          introducing new products. Installation of the newest whiz-bang machines 
          is a double-edged sword. It gives customers a chance for a very different 
          experience. But, having a few machines from each of many vendors can 
          cause headaches. Every model needs its own inventory of parts and trained 
          repair personnel. If Casino Online managers believe they have a shot at attracting 
          high-rollers, it brings on a difficult design problem. Setting up high 
          limit gaming areas can give big money players the feeling they're in 
          a special place-away from the rabble. On the other hand, if you move 
          those tables too far away from the rest of the action, the sense of 
          excitement might disappear. Again, it's a part of that tricky art of 
          knowing the customers and what they want. Computers are changing the 
          way business works in every industry, gaming is no exception. Information 
          management systems should be built into any new Casino Online. Player tracking 
          and online slot monitoring systems are now standard issue equipment 
          for modern Casino Onlines. </P>
        <P>We encourage clients to look to the future as well. A little expense 
          today can make the transition to a "smart card" based system easy in 
          the future. No one knows quite what the future holds, but we know the 
          trend is toward more and more electronic transactions. Anything that 
          gives the customer convenient options for payment should be considered. 
          Proprietary systems with no options for expansion will probably come 
          back to haunt the purchasers sooner rather than later. A high-tech amenity 
          that's easy to overlook is modem access in hotel rooms. Many affluent 
          guests need to stay connected to the outside world. Having a "business 
          travelers" room with personal computers is a nice touch. But, even better 
          is making sure guests can connect a laptop computer to the phone line 
          in their room so they can check e-mail with their own computer. It all 
          begins with the customer. A Casino Online operator with a solid understanding 
          of who is going to come through the door stands a good chance of putting 
          the right pieces together. Even in the competitive market of 1998, the 
          right Casino Online in the right place stands a fighting chance. SIDEBAR (Casino Online 
          Design Checklist) STEP A: Determine the market segments. 1. Local 2. 
          Conventions 3. Tour and Travel 4. Free independent travelers 5. Invited 
          Guests STEP B: Determine the scale 1. Cost limits - What can we afford? 
          2. Market analysis - Consider the location. What is the potential customer 
          draw? 3. Competition - Where would we fit in the market? 4. Support 
          facilities - How many rooms? How much parking? Number and size of restaurants? 
          Bars? Change booths, etc? 5. Recompute estimated cost - Can we afford 
          what we have planned? STEP C: Develop the floor plan 1. Traffic flow 
          - How will the people move to and from the support facilities and through 
          the gaming area? 2. Bus customers (if applicable) - Are there restrooms 
          next to the bus door? Are there eating facilities where people can be 
          served quickly and inexpensively? 3. Customers drawn by restaurant - 
          Will the restaurant traffic have to flow past the games? 4. Operational 
          movement - Can we move inventory, including money, to and from service 
          areas easily and securely? 5. Future expansion - Have we provided for 
          a direction to grow? Does it include more than just Casino Online floor expansion? 
          STEP D: Create the proper atmosphere 1. Games mix (ratio of crap games 
          to blackjack games; table games to slot machines, and within the slot 
          machines, the ration of denomination and type) - Is the mix consistent 
          with marketing style? Will it provide a high level of unit play? 2. 
          Games arrangement - Can the employees service the games? Can the customers 
          move past them, yet form comfortable groups? 3. Interior design - Does 
          the Casino Online design add excitement? Do the lights enhance the games or 
          wash them out? 4. Seasonal flexibility - Will the floor be as exciting 
          when cut back to less than a full selection of games? </P>
