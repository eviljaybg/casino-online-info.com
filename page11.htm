  <p align="left">Installation of the newest whiz-bang machines is a double-edged 
    sword. It gives customers a chance for a very different experience. But, having 
    a few machines from each of many vendors can cause headaches. Every model 
    needs its own inventory of parts and trained repair personnel. If Casino Online managers 
    believe they have a shot at attracting high-rollers, it brings on a difficult 
    design problem. Setting up high limit gaming areas can give big money players 
    the feeling they're in a special place-away from the rabble. On the other 
    hand, if you move those tables too far away from the rest of the action, the 
    sense of excitement might disappear. Again, it's a part of that tricky art 
    of knowing the customers and what they want. Computers are changing the way 
    business works in every industry, gaming is no exception. Information management 
    systems should be built into any new Casino Online. Player tracking and online slot 
    monitoring systems are now standard issue equipment for modern Casino Onlines. </p>
  <p align="left">We encourage clients to look to the future as well. A little 
    expense today can make the transition to a "smart card" based system easy 
    in the future. No one knows quite what the future holds, but we know the trend 
    is toward more and more electronic transactions. </p>
  <p align="left">Anything that gives the customer convenient options for payment 
    should be considered. Proprietary systems with no options for expansion will 
    probably come back to haunt the purchasers sooner rather than later. A high-tech 
    amenity that's easy to overlook is modem access in hotel rooms. Many affluent 
    guests need to stay connected to the outside world. Having a "business travelers" 
    room with personal computers is a nice touch. </p>
  <p align="left">But, even better is making sure guests can connect a laptop 
    computer to the phone line in their room so they can check e-mail with their 
    own computer. It all begins with the customer. A Casino Online operator with a solid 
    understanding of who is going to come through the door stands a good chance 
    of putting the right pieces together. Even in the competitive market of 1998, 
    the right Casino Online in the right place stands a fighting chance. SIDEBAR (Casino Online 
    Design Checklist) STEP A: Determine the market segments. </p>
  <p align="left">1. Local</p>
  <p align="left"> 2. Conventions</p>
  <p align="left"> 3. Tour and Travel</p>
  <p align="left"> 4. Free independent travelers 5. Invited Guests STEP B: Determine 
    the scale 1. Cost limits - What can we afford? 2. Market analysis - Consider 
    the location. What is the potential customer draw? 3. Competition - Where 
    would we fit in the market? 4. Support facilities - How many rooms? How much 
    parking? Number and size of restaurants? Bars? Change booths, etc? 5. Recompute 
    estimated cost - Can we afford what we have planned? STEP C: Develop the floor 
    plan 1. Traffic flow - How will the people move to and from the support facilities 
    and through the gaming area? 2. Bus customers (if applicable) - Are there 
    restrooms next to the bus door? Are there eating facilities where people can 
    be served quickly and inexpensively? </p>
  <p align="left">3. Customers drawn by restaurant - Will the restaurant traffic 
    have to flow past the games? 4. Operational movement - Can we move inventory, 
    including money, to and from service areas easily and securely? 5. Future 
    expansion - Have we provided for a direction to grow? Does it include more 
    than just Casino Online floor expansion? STEP D: Create the proper atmosphere 1. 
    Games mix (ratio of crap games to blackjack games; table games to slot machines, 
    and within the slot machines, the ration of denomination and type) - Is the 
    mix consistent with marketing style? Will it provide a high level of unit 
    play? 2. Games arrangement - Can the employees service the games? Can the 
    customers move past them, yet form comfortable groups? 3. Interior design 
    - Does the Casino Online design add excitement? Do the lights enhance the games or 
    wash them out? 4. Seasonal flexibility - Will the floor be as exciting when 
    cut back to less than a full selection of games? </p>
