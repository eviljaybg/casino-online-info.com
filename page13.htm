          How to win in the Casino Online</P>
        <P> Increases in average bet can be encouraged by a number of means. The 
          breakdown of chips for the buy-in is the first opportunity a Casino Online 
          has for the encouragement. For example, if the player in our model is 
          given $1 tokens for his $100 buy-in, he is probably less likely to maintain 
          an average bet as high as another player who is given $5 chips. The 
          same concept probably applies to how winning bets are paid. If a player 
          wins a $50 bet that consisted of $5 chips and he is paid in $25 chips, 
          he is more likely to be upgraded in average play than a player who is 
          paid with $5 chips. The limits on a game can also affect the average 
          bet. 
        <P>The minimum and maximum limit is generally intended to prevent the 
          player from doubling his bet continually until he wins. However, the 
          Casino Online might agree to take the limit off if a player agrees to play 
          at least a minimum amount for a specific period of time. Another technique 
          is to increase the table minimum as the play on that table increases.
        <P> House Advantage: The sources quoted earlier gave a range of -.1% to 
          +15.0% for single deck twenty-one play. The range depended upon the 
          strategy of play used by the player. Rouge et Noir issued a staff report 
          in 1983 that included rather sophisticated mathematical approaches to 
          hold percentages and concluded that the use of two decks would increase 
          the hold percentage by +.2%, and four decks would increase it by +.4%. 
          The twenty-one manager can consider the rules under which the games 
          are to be played. He needs to encourage play, but must consider the 
          house advantage as rules are established.
        <P> The surrender rule in Atlantic City was popular with the players, 
          but not with the twenty-one managers. Rule restrictions that favor the 
          house are as follows: Rules that Increase the House Percentage Rule 
          Restrictions Increase in House Advantage Dealer hits soft 17 +0.2 No 
          soft doubling down +0.1 No doubling down on 11 +0.8 No doubling down 
          on 10 +0.5 No doubling down on 9 +0.1 No doubling down except 9, 10 
          or 11 +0.2 No doubling down after splitting +0.2 No splitting of aces 
          +0.2 Tie hands are won by the dealer +9.0 Hands Per Hour: Hands per 
          hour is important, but has numerous ramifications for the twenty-one 
          manager to consider. 
        <P>Casino Online philosophies differ widely on this subject because of player 
          attitude. The faster the game the less time the dealer has to talk to 
          the players. Some players enjoy fast games while others, particularly 
          those just learning to play, become irritated by game speed and, therefore, 
          unhappy. The single deck twenty-one creates a problem for both the dealer 
          and the player if the hands per hour is increased too much. Game speed 
          can be accomplished without detrimental effects by using a multiple 
          deck shoe. A new invention is being tested in Atlantic City that automatically 
          shuffles the cards. With multiple deck shoes and automatic shuffling, 
          hands per hour can be greatly increased.
        <P> The twenty-one manager must consider all these factors as well as 
          his players, adjust the game speed, and monitor the hold percentage 
          to develop the proper balance for his games. Hours Played: This is the 
          most difficult problem the twenty-one manager faces. It ranges from 
          the attitude of a player who wants to quit when he is ahead, to the 
          personal egos of those not getting enough attention. In between are 
          the problems of : Player Comfort: Are the stools comfortable to sit 
          at for a long period of time? Does the player get enough to drink to 
          keep him happy? Are the lights too bright or too dark? Is the music 
          too loud or too soft? Mandatory Playing Time: If he is on a junket and 
          has agreed to playing time, how do you monitor his activity? Grading 
          of Player: Are good players spotted and given personal attention, such 
          as a complimentary dinner or overnight lodging to encourage them to 
          stay in the game? Even though the hold percentage of a twenty-one game 
          is not the same statistically as the hold percentage of a slot machine, 
          it is still a very valuable management tool. The Nevada Gaming Control 
          Board reported hold percentages as shown in the following table:
