    <p>The 1-3-2-6 System The name of this system says it all. It is similar to 
      the Paroli system. It is based on the premise that you can win four times 
      in a row. Your initial bet is 1 unit, the second 3 units, the third 2 units 
      and the fourth 6 units. Let's assume that each unit is $10 and the odds 
      are 1:1 - even money. The first bet is $10. When winning, $10 is added to 
      the $20 on the table making the second bet $30. When winning again on the 
      second bet, there would be $60 on the table. Of this you take down $40 and 
      the third bet is now $20. If the third bet wins, you will have $40 on the 
      table to which you add $20 making a total of $60 for the fourth bet. If 
      the fourth bet wins, there would be a total of $120, of which $100 is net 
      profit. Now all the bet with the profit is taken down and you start the 
      system all over again at $10. If you lose the first bet, your loss is $10. 
      The second level loss is $20. At the third level, a loss will give you a 
      net profit of $20. At the fourth level, a loss leaves you breaking even. 
      Each time you lose, you start all over again at $10. The attraction of this 
      system is that you risk $20 at a chance of making $100 net profit. This 
      means you can lose five times, and with one win get your money back. </p>
    <p>Whatever your gambling activity, below are my three best gambling tips 
      for the general punter or bettor, in order of importance that I consider 
      essential in your quest for success. The result of over 30 years' gambling 
      experience. Call them punter tips, gambling tips or golden rules. Stick 
      to them and you will probably be a winner, stay a winner and enjoy gambling 
      for a long time tocome with no pain and no regrets. </p>
    <p>Tips for the general punter: 1st tip: Gamble money you can afford to lose. 
      If you need the money, don't gamble. 2nd tip: Gamble half of what you are 
      willing to risk. This way, if you don't win, you will give yourself a second 
      chance, another day. 3rd tip: Don't be greedy; if you lose what you have 
      just won, you are. Tips for the methodical gambler: If you bet methodically 
      or want to devise your own betting system, then these are my three best 
      gambling tips: 1st tip: Employ this 'one-way' winning strategy: Start with 
      minimal bets. When winning, intensify the betting progressively as you win 
      risking only a calculated portion of your wins. Put NO limit to winnings 
      as long as profit is progressing. 2nd tip: Set your target profit levels 
      backwards. It is easier to fulfil a target level backwards (as profit recedes) 
      than forward. The danger of forward profit targeting is that you can get 
      close to it, never quite make it, and then lose the lot. Backward profit 
      level targeting is more suitable on low risk/win ratio betting systems; 
      that is, you risk a little to win a lot but you win fewer times. Therefore 
      when devising your system you should aim to win more money with fewer bets 
      and in fewer winning rounds, hands or cues. Positive progression betting 
      is one way to achieve that. This is usually a more efficient way to bet 
      and gives you more flexibility in managing your winnings. 3rd tip: Approach 
      gambling realistically. You cannot force a winning outcome and don't expect 
      to win every time. Decide on a plan that lets you play in sessions or intervals, 
      closing each session once certain criteria are met, and don't aim to win 
      each one of them. Remember, what matters is the overall net profit result.
