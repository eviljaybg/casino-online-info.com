    <p>the casino onlines make their money by paying off bets at less than the 
      true odds. this is the house edge <aa060598.htm>. lets take a look at how 
      this effects you and your bankroll. the money it cost us to play a game 
      in relation to the house edge is called the expected value or ev. the ev 
      is actually the average outcome determined by multiplying the average bet 
      times the number of hands per hour (hph) times the house edge. based on 
      our chart <../bledge.htm>we can figure out the EV of any game for each hour 
      we play. For this example we will use a $5 bet. The figure is what it costs 
      you to play the negative expectation games, (i.e. games with a house edge). 
    </p>
    <p>Roulette: $5 x 50 HPH x 5.26 = $13.15 </p>
    <p>Craps: $5 x 30 HPH x 1.4 = $ 2.10 </p>
    <p>Caribbean Stud : $5 x 40 HPH x 5.3 = $10.60</p>
    <p> BlackJack: $5 x 60 HPH x 0.5 = $ 1.50 </p>
    <p>Look at the game of Roulette. You will see that the house edge is 5.26% 
      for the double zero game. This is how we figure the edge. In the game there 
      are 36 numbers plus the 0 and 00. The odd of you winning is one in 38 or 
      1/38. If you win the casino pays you 35 for you dollars bet. You keep your 
      original dollar, and are paid $35. The difference is Two Dollars (38 minus 
      36). Divide the $2 by 38 which is the true odds and you come up with the 
      house edge of 5.26%. So you could actually cover all the numbers on the 
      layout and still lose money. Great odds for the house, but not for you. 
      Games like Roulette, Craps, Big Six a have a fixed percentage because one 
      roll or spin will never change the out come. There will always be 38 numbers 
      on a roulette layout and 12 numbers on a pair of dice. Blackjack is in a 
      different category because every time a card comes out of the shoe, it changes 
      the make up of the cards remaining. The advantage can shift from player 
      to house depending on which cards have been played and the Skill in which 
      you play your cards.. Video Poker also is based on skill. If you play the 
      perfect strategy, there are actually some games that have a positive return 
      based on their pay table. We will discuss these games in the future. </p>
    <p>I also invite anyone to post a "Trip Report" that they think will be of 
      interest others considering a similar trip. do you have a question about 
      a specific game? why not post a message on the board. if you have a winning 
      system or tip you want to share to help others, this is the place to do 
      it. this is your forum and i hope you will make use of it. if you have questions
