        <P>Casino Onlline Guide To Gamblling</P>
        <P>The following is a few that I have found. While not all of them are 
          updated as timely as the others, they all are worth taking a look at. 
          Rolling Good Times is the premiere gambling Zine on the internet. They 
          were the first and in my opinion are the best. RGT defines itself as 
          the "Comprehensive online magazine for gaming enthusiasts..Hot tips, 
          news and advice to make you a better player" They accomplish this with 
          articles by such well known gambling authors as Larry Edell, Frank Scoblete, 
          Henry Tamburin and a host of others.</P>
        <p> You can sign up for the "News Flash" and be contacted with the updates 
          that happen weekly. The Gamemaster is billed as the "Zine with an attitude 
          for the man about town with a focus and commitment on winning" Gamemaster 
          delivers on this promise with timely news stories and some solid articles 
          about all the games. You can find advice on anything from horse racing 
          to Video Poker. Columnist include Chuck Wenstein from Conjelco and Mark 
          Pilarski and some excellent advice from "The Gamemaster." An E-mail 
          "News Flash" is also available to those wishing to be notified of updates. 
          Bettor's Luck offers a fine variety of interesting articles for gamblers. 
          News stories and gambling advice columns are updated monthly. You can 
          even find a humour feature and your gambling "Horoscope". Some of this 
          months articles discuss topics from Megabucks to Beginners Baccarat. 
          I think this is one of the up and coming zines.</p>
        <p> Gamblers Den is also a newer entry to the gambling zines. You can 
          find the a wide range of articles and information concerning the gaming 
          industry. I'm not sure how often this one is updated. each one of these 
          zines has something of interest. take a few moments to check them out. 
          for your convenience you can access them from this site. just click 
          on the news <../../msub5.htm>link on the right side of the home page.

          Dakota's and Connecticut's Wheel of Fortune $1 jackpot was $2,141,925 
          - starts at $500,000. Atlantic City, Mississippi and Nevada starts at 
          $1 million. South Dakota & Connecticut's High Roller $5 game starts 
          at $1.5 million. New Jersey and Mississippi's High Roller $5 game starts 
          at $1 million. The Las Vegas Strip has the most slot machines in the 
          state, but their payouts are lower than the Downtown Casino Onlines and Boulder 
          Strip Casino Onlines. The Strip has around 60,000 machines, downtown 16,000, 
          Boulder Hwy. 15,000, Reno 14,000, Laughlin 11,500 and Lake Tahoe 6,215. 
          If your going to play Mega Jackpot machines, study the machines and 
          our charts very carefully. Sometimes a three-coin quarter machine will 
          have the same progressive jackpot as a three-coin one dollar, or two-coin 
          five dollar machine.</P>
        <P> This fact is often overlooked by slot players. We see people playing 
          machines such as the 3-coin "Blazing Seven's" that require you to play 
          all three coins to be paid for any winning combination shown on the 
          machine. The machine clearly states to "play 3-coins." If you look at 
          the front of the machine it tells you what the payout is for playing 
          only one coin, two coins or all three coins. Slot players often wonder 
          why they didn't get paid when they hit a combination of double or triple 
          bars, a combination of sevens, or the three blazing seven's that pays 
          the progressive jackpot -- if they read the information on the machine 
          they would know -- and also realize they are throwing their money away 
          playing less than maximum coins. If your only playing one or two coins 
          play a machine that shows the various combinations and payouts for each 
          coin played. Some machines require as many as 45 coins (a nickel machine 
          in downtown Las Vegas) to win the jackpot. One machine may pay 2000 
          coins for one coin played, another 5000 coins for the one coin. Another 
          machine to avoid with less tham maximum coins is the five line that 
          pays if you hit three symbols or bars on a straight line, or from corner 
          to corner. If your a one or two coin player look for machines such as 
          the Double Diamonds or Triple Diamonds, Wild Cherries, Cash, Sevens, 
          Five Times, Bananas, Red White & Blue, etc. If your playing one of the 
          progressive machines for a mega jackpot, keep in mind that they do not 
          have as many payouts as the non-progressive machine do. We can not stress 
          this enough -- study the machines payouts carefully before you play 
          it. Connecticut also has "Nickelmania" 3-coin, starts at $100,000; "Wheel 
          of Gold" 3-Quarters, starts at $200,000 and "Pinball Mania" 4-Quarters, 
          starts at $200,000 Always join the slot club if you play the machines. 
          Slot club players receive more perks than table players because they 
          are risking more money per hour. If you bet $3.00 at a table game, how 
          many hands per hour are you playing -- 30 to 60? Your risking $90 to 
          $180 per hour and chances are you'll win a fair portion of those hands. 
          The slot player can play 15 to 20 spins per minute, risking $45 to $60 
          per minute or $3,600 per hour. That's why slot players receive better 
          comps than table game players. Even at $25 a bet, the player is risking 
          $1,500 per hour, but keep in mind the Casino Online odds are much lower on 
          table games than slot machines. If you're playing in an area with numerous 
          Casino Onlines, carefully check out the comp paybacks. Some reward the player 
          with one point per $10 of play, others one point for every $20 of play, 
          some like the Gold Coast in Las Vegas and Casino Online Rama in Rama, Ontario 
          with prizes instead of cash. The Foxwood and Mohegan Sun in CT aren't 
          very generous with comps due to lack of competition. Atlantic City mails 
          your comp in a coupon, you have to return to collect what is owed to 
          you. Atlantic City comps are only good for up to six months, comps in 
          Las Vegas are good for up to three years. Caesars Atlantic City has 
          the new "Elvis" slot machines with jackpots starting at $100,000, paid 
          in full if you win, no annuity payments. The Elvis machines have bonus 
          rounds with average payouts of 50 to 100 coins, more frequent payouts 
          than the popular "Wheel of Fortune" machines. Other machines include 
          "Triple Play Joker Poker," "Monopoly" and "Slotopoly." Eldorado in Reno. 
          The Eldorado Poker Room offers No-Limit Texas Hold-em games nightly, 
          except Sundays, beginning at 7 p.m. Other games spread daily include 
          $3/6 Limit Hold-em, $4/8 Limit Hold-em, $6/12 Limit Hold-em, Seven Card 
          Stud and Omaha High-Low Split. Information (800) 777-5325 or (775) 786-5700 
          ext. 7100. Flamingo Hilton in Las Vegas is comping players with a Junior 
          Suite if slot club members play the $1.00 slots with max. coins for 
          at least four-hours. Must be a member of their Flamingo Magic Club. 
          Membership is free. The Gold Mine Casino Online in Black Hawk, CO has replaced 
          their higher denomination slot machines with 1-cent and 5-cent machines, 
          lowered their Blackjack table limits from $2 and $5 to only 50-cents. 
          Black Hawk has 19 Casino Onlines, Cripple Creek 22, the entire state of Colorado 
          49. Colorado Casino Onlines grossed $480 million in 1998. Harrah's Las Vegas 
          will reimburse you for loses up to $100 if you join their Total Gold 
          Card slot club. Play any twenty-five cent or higher machine for at least 
          one hour and Harrah's will reimburse your loses to $100. Iowa state 
          government think they found a way to combat the gambling problem. ATMs 
          in Casino Onlines will not allow players to make cash advances on their cards, 
          only draw out available funds and pay their bills with a charge card. 
          Lady Luck in downtown Las Vegas was voted the Best for Comps, Best Fun 
          Book. The book has coupons valued at over $350.00. MGM Grand has a "Fly 
          Lots" program that allows you to build air mileage points if you belong 
          to American Airlines AAdvantage club. This is in-addition to your regular 
          points. Nevada grossed nearly $7.75 billion in 1998, made a profit of 
          $1.13 billion. That's why so many states want to get into the act of 
          having Casino Online gambling in their state. New Jersey draws the most gaming 
          tourist, 35 million a year, most on one day bus trips. Las Vegas drew 
          30.5 million in 1998, Mississippi Gulf Coast became the third most popular 
          gaming area, Reno drew 5.2 million. Station Casino Onlines had their Megabucks 
          and Wheel of Fortune machines removed. Las Vegas Casino Onlines are tired of 
          making lease payments to the slot manufactures so their replacing lease 
          machines with machines they can purchase outright. Business has improved 
          for Station Casino Onlines. </P> </TD>
