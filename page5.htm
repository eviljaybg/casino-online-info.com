        <P>Casino Online Information Site 
        <P>If your only playing one or two coins play a machine that shows the 
          various combinations and payouts for each coin played. Some machines 
          require as many as 45 coins (a nickel machine in downtown Las Vegas) 
          to win the jackpot. One machine may pay 2000 coins for one coin played, 
          another 5000 coins for the one coin. Another machine to avoid with less 
          tham maximum coins is the five line that pays if you hit three symbols 
          or bars on a straight line, or from corner to corner. If your a one 
          or two coin player look for machines such as the Double Diamonds or 
          Triple Diamonds, Wild Cherries, Cash, Sevens, Five Times, Bananas, Red 
          White & Blue, etc. If your playing one of the progressive machines for 
          a mega jackpot, keep in mind that they do not have as many payouts as 
          the non-progressive machine do.
        <P>This fact is often overlooked by slot players. We see people playing 
          machines such as the 3-coin "Blazing Seven's" that require you to play 
          all three coins to be paid for any winning combination shown on the 
          machine. The machine clearly states to "play 3-coins." If you look at 
          the front of the machine it tells you what the payout is for playing 
          only one coin, two coins or all three coins. Slot players often wonder 
          why they didn't get paid when they hit a combination of double or triple 
          bars, a combination of sevens, or the three blazing seven's that pays 
          the progressive jackpot -- if they read the information on the machine 
          they would know -- and also realize they are throwing their money away 
          playing less than maximum coins.</P>
        <P> We can not stress this enough -- study the machines payouts carefully 
          before you play it. Connecticut also has "Nickelmania" 3-coin, starts 
          at $100,000; "Wheel of Gold" 3-Quarters, starts at $200,000 and "Pinball 
          Mania" 4-Quarters, starts at $200,000 Always join the slot club if you 
          play the machines. Slot club players receive more perks than table players 
          because they are risking more money per hour. If you bet $3.00 at a 
          table game, how many hands per hour are you playing -- 30 to 60? Your 
          risking $90 to $180 per hour and chances are you'll win a fair portion 
          of those hands. The slot player can play 15 to 20 spins per minute, 
          risking $45 to $60 per minute or $3,600 per hour. That's why slot players 
          receive better comps than table game players. Even at $25 a bet, the 
          player is risking $1,500 per hour, but keep in mind the Casino Online odds 
          are much lower on table games than slot machines. If you're playing 
          in an area with numerous Casino Onlines, carefully check out the comp paybacks. 
          Some reward the player with one point per $10 of play, others one point 
          for every $20 of play, some like the Gold Coast in Las Vegas and Casino Online 
          Rama in Rama, Ontario with prizes instead of cash. The Foxwood and Mohegan 
          Sun in CT aren't very generous with comps due to lack of competition.</P>
        <P> Atlantic City mails your comp in a coupon, you have to return to collect 
          what is owed to you. Atlantic City comps are only good for up to six 
          months, comps in Las Vegas are good for up to three years. Caesars Atlantic 
          City has the new "Elvis" slot machines with jackpots starting at $100,000, 
          paid in full if you win, no annuity payments. The Elvis machines have 
          bonus rounds with average payouts of 50 to 100 coins, more frequent 
          payouts than the popular "Wheel of Fortune" machines. Other machines 
          include "Triple Play Joker Poker," "Monopoly" and "Slotopoly." Eldorado 
          in Reno. The Eldorado Poker Room offers No-Limit Texas Hold-em games 
          nightly, except Sundays, beginning at 7 p.m.</P>
        <P> Other games spread daily include $3/6 Limit Hold-em, $4/8 Limit Hold-em, 
          $6/12 Limit Hold-em, Seven Card Stud and Omaha High-Low Split. Information

          $1.00 slots with max. coins for at least four-hours. Must be a member 
          of their Flamingo Magic Club. Membership is free. The Gold Mine Casino Online 
          in Black Hawk, CO has replaced their higher denomination slot machines 
          with 1-cent and 5-cent machines, lowered their Blackjack table limits 
          from $2 and $5 to only 50-cents. Black Hawk has 19 Casino Onlines, Cripple 
          Creek 22, the entire state of Colorado 49. Colorado Casino Onlines grossed 
          $480 million in 1998. Harrah's Las Vegas will reimburse you for loses

          cent or higher machine for at least one hour and Harrah's will reimburse 
          your loses to $100. Iowa state government think they found a way to 
          combat the gambling problem. ATMs in Casino Onlines will not allow players 
          to make cash advances on their cards, only draw out available funds 
          and pay their bills with a charge card. Lady Luck in downtown Las Vegas 
          was voted the Best for Comps, Best Fun Book.</P>
        <P> The book has coupons valued at over $350.00. MGM Grand has a "Fly 
          Lots" program that allows you to build air mileage points if you belong 
          to American Airlines AAdvantage club. This is in-addition to your regular 
          points. Nevada grossed nearly $7.75 billion in 1998, made a profit of 
          $1.13 billion. That's why so many states want to get into the act of 
          having Casino Online gambling in their state. New Jersey draws the most gaming 
          tourist, 35 million a year, most on one day bus trips. Las Vegas drew 
          30.5 million in 1998, Mississippi Gulf Coast became the third most popular 
          gaming area, Reno drew 5.2 million. Station Casino Onlines had their Megabucks 
          and Wheel of Fortune machines removed. Las Vegas Casino Onlines are tired of 
          making lease payments to the slot manufactures so their replacing lease 
          machines with machines they can purchase outright. Business has improved 
          for Station Casino Onlines. </P>
