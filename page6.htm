          Online</a> "Upon opening the door to the sparkling new cyberCasino Online, 
          I found the overall look and feel to be satisfying and registration 
          and entry to be painless, which is always a big plus. The first thing 
          I noticed about the games in general was that they did a nice job emulating 
          the experience of playing at a real Casino Online, while being careful 
          not to overdo it. A lot of attention was given to details, from their 
          fairly accurate depiction of authentic-looking games to the sounds of 
          slots rolling and chips clicking. Even the ATM looks and works just 
          like the real thing. </P>
        <p>The progressive slots play just as (if not more) rapidly than those 
          at a real Casino Online, which makes the fact that the "machine" takes 
          nickels a relief. You can also play with quarters, ones and fives, and 
          can bet as many as four tokens. If you get a kick out of pulling the 
          lever, that option is available. It would be nice if you could enter 
          more than one token at a time, although you can pop them suckers in 
          there pretty quickly.</p>
        <p> The sound the buttons make when pressed is a nice touch. The same 
          can be said about their version of video poker, a five-coin-max, five 
          card draw game also taking nickels, quarters, $1 and $5 tokens. Overall, 
          problems were minimal, and I think this is because they didn't try to 
          overcomplicate things. I was pleased with the general atmosphere and 
          a think they did a fine job of nailing the genuine Casino Online experience. 
          The interface is very functional and support is easily accessible. ...Starnet's
