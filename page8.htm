        <P>The Royal Bet offers both a Casino Online and a Sportsbook, which is convenient 
          for those who like both Casino Online and sports wagering. In this review I 
          cover only the Casino Online. The first thing I did was download the Casino Online 
          software which I did with no problems. The 'lite' software came with 
          only four games (Blackjack, Pai Gow Poker, Gold Rush Slots and Jacks 
          Video Poker), but I was happy to see that I could download up to 18 
          more games once the software was installed on my computer. </P>
        <P>You can also play 4 java games online for fun or real, which is nice 
          if you don't like downloads. If it's more convenient for you The Royal 
          Bet also offers the full range of their Casino Online games on CD that they 
          will send to you free of charge. The games I tried played smooth and 
          fast and I had absolutely no technical problems. They were all good 
          quality and enough fun to keep playing for quite a long time. The graphics 
          were crisp and it was easy to understand how to navigate and play even 
          without reading any instructions. The Royal Bet offers a 10% bonus on 
          your initial deposit, a frequent player bonus program as well as a comp 
          program.</P>
        <P> According to their website they are a member of The Ethical Online 
          Gaming Association and their games have been independently certified 
          as 100% random. They also offer a toll-free customer support line to 
          answer your questions. All in all my experience with Royal Bet was very 
          positive and I felt I was dealing with a reputable company. Although 
          I only played the games for fun, the rush of real Casino Online action was 
          there and I will return soon with cash in hand. The Colosseum Casino Online 
          I suppose that it was the Roman habit of wagering on gladiator contests 
          that makes the theme so popular in modern online Casino Onlines. The creators 
          of the Colosseum Casino Online used the theme sparingly, and interspersed traditional 
          Casino Online colors into the design. The result is a pleasant change from 
          the midnight in Las Vegas look that many online Casino Onlines adopt. The graphics 
          are clean, and the site very easy to navigate. There are no free java 
          games for instant play. If you wish to play for real or for fun (the 
          term they use is "guest player"), you have to download the software. 
          There are full instructions that are detailed and easy to follow.</P>
        <P> The games are downloaded in a manner that is slightly different than 
          what you may be used to if you have already gambled in other online 
          Casino Onlines. Initially only a few games are activated, although the links 
          for the others are present in a greyed out version. If you wish to play 
          one of these games, you click on the icon and that particular game will 
          be downloaded. There are 19 games in all, so there is a good selection, 
          including the traditional favorites, and some new games. Each game is 
          complete with a help file for those who are just starting out. I didn't 
          read through the file, but it seemed to be extensive and very…well…helpful! 
        </P>
        <P>The Coloseum Casino Online provides you with both cyber support through e-mail, 
          and real-time through the telephone numbers provided. For those of you 
          who are worried about the odds being legitimate in online Casino Onlines, the 
          Price Waterhouse Cooper seal on the home page is assuring. But then 
          Micro Gaming, the gaming software company this Casino Online utilizes, is one 
          of the major suppliers and is known to be reliable. Processing of your 
          credit card is via secure transaction. All of these are very big plus 
          factors in deciding what online Casino Online to trust your money with. This 
          Casino Online comes up a winner on all points. William Hill Casino Online William 
          Hill Casino Online takes the online gaming experience to the next level. The 
          realism of the games, along with the dealers talking to you at the tables 
          games and the 3D walk-in hall makes this a better than life Casino Online. 
          The layout is simple and easy to navigate. They offer all the Casino Online 
          favorites in their single player format such as Blackjack, Caribbean 
          Stud, 3 Reel Slots, Pai Gow Poker, Video Poker, Video Keno, Baccarat, 
          Craps, Let It Ride, and Red Dog. Their multiplayer format includes Baccarat, 
          Blackjack and Roulette. This place is defenetly worth a visit! </P>
