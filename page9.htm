        <P><A HREF="/index.html">Casino Online</A>Standard Deviation = 1.1 divided by 
          the square root of the number of hands played. Lets say we played 100 
          hands. The square root of 100 is 10. we divide 1.1 by 10 and come up 
          with 11% or 11 units (11% of 100 hands). If we are playing $5 per hand 
          one unit would equal $5. so our standard deviation would be $55. If 
          we are playing Blackjack , we figure that the EV is minus $2.50 for 
          100 hands. We find that the range for one standard deviation (68% of 
          the time) is between: -$56.50 and +$52.50 -$2.50 + plus $55 = plus $52.50 
          -$2.50 + minus $55 = minus 57.50 Doubling the standard deviation will 
          give us a 95% accurate range between: -$112.50 and +$107.50. This is 
          a pretty wild fluctuation for our bankroll. It also shows how bad things 
          can get when we lose and what we can realistically expect to win.</P>
        <P> Because we are playing against the house edge our LOSES will always 
          be greater than our WINS in the long run. The chart below shows a Bell 
          Curve of the single and double standard deviation Knowing this, our 
          best bet is to walk away from the table when we find ourselves in the 
          positive range. The longer we play the more chance of getting closer 
          to the EV which we know is negative. Now we know the Price We Pay To 
          Play. Welcome to the Casino Online Gambling Forum. This is the place where

          are also welcome On Thursday July 23, 1998 , The Senate voted overwhelmingly 
          90 to 10 to try to shut down the billion dollar Internet gambling industry, 
          calling it addictive, a corrupting influence on the young, and a source 
          of crime growing out of control. The Bill by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz, was 
          included as an amendment to a $33.2 billion spending bill covering the 
          Commerce, Justice and State departments in fiscal 1999, starting Oct. 
          1. The Senate passed the overall spending bill on a 99-0 vote. In the 
          House, neither the spending bill nor an Internet gambling ban measure 
          has reached the floor, but it is expected to sweep through the House 
          and be signed into law by President Clinton this year. "Internet gambling 
          is unregulated, accessible by minors, addictive, subject to abuse for 
          fraudulent purposes like money laundering, evasive of state gambling 
          laws -- and already illegal at the federal level in many cases," said 
          Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., chief sponsor of the measure. Unchecked, Internet 
          gambling revenues could reach $10 billion by 2000, Kyl warned. As many 
          as 140 gambling sites have sprung up on the Internet in recent years, 
          and more than $600 million was wagered online last year on sports alone.</P>
        <P> A 10-fold increase in just one year, according to the Justice Department. 
          Most of the sites are operated by businesses based overseas, which lobbied 
          against Kyl's measure. Although Kyl's provision does not detail enforcement 
          procedures, he said he anticipates that federal law enforcement officials 
          would carry out its requirements by identifying Web sites that provide 
          illegal gambling and seeking court orders enjoining such activity and 
          requiring Internet service providers to "pull the plug" on access to 
          those sites. This would mean that the service providers would need to 
          install filtering software to block customer access to cybergambling. 
          If it becomes law the gambling ban would be the most far reaching internet 
          legislation since the Communications Decency Act of 1996. That Bill 
          which barred indecent and "offensive" materials on the net, was ruled 
          unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. Under the provision, 
          individual gamblers could be imprisoned for three months and fined $500. 
          Businesses running gambling sites could be imprisoned for four years 
          and fined $20,000 or three times the amount of bets accepted. Supporters 
          of the bill argue that the ban is necessary because of the difficulty 
          of trying to regulate "Virtual Casino Onlines". The easy access and anonymity 
          for bettors makes it possible for youngsters who get their hands on 
          a parent's credit cards to run up debt, they claim.</P>
        <P> Representatives of states that have refused to legalise games of chance 
          expressed concern that residents cannot be prevented from signing in 
          and placing wagers on sporting events or the turn of a card in virtual 
          Casino Onlines operated from locations thousands of miles away. A recent State 
          Department report also criticised foreign Internet gambling operations 
          in places like Antigua for providing a haven for money launderers. Sue 
          Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Internet gambling industry, assailed 
          the Senate for placing "a blockade around the U.S." while other countries, 
          such as Australia, permit cyberspace gambling. She also noted with disdain 
          that Senators chose to carve out exceptions for lotteries and parimutuel 
          betting. "It's really not prohibition; it has exceptions," said Schneider, 
          who chairs the Interactive Gaming Council. The Bill contains exceptions 
          that would allow states to conduct lotteries over the Internet. In addition, 
          off-track betting on horse and dog races would be permitted as long 
          as wagers are placed on subscriber-based computer systems that are not 
          accessible to the general public. Also permitted under the measure are 
          the popular sports "fantasy" or "rotisserie" leagues, in which fans 
          create their own roster of professional athletes and bet on how well 
          their teams will do. However, the fees that Internet sites charge for 
          using these sites could not be used to pay off bets. </P>
        <P>Others opposed to the Bill include the ISP Consortium, a Minneapolis-based 
          organisation that represents 300 internet service providers worldwide. 
          "We adamantly oppose the idea of turning ISPs into Traffic cops" said 
          Justin Newton, public policy director of the group. "It is technologically 
          impossible to track all the content that travels over the online services."

          wanted to take this opportunity to tell all of you about some new features

          "Luck comes and goes...Knowledge stays forever." Online magazines, commonly 
          referred to as "Zines" have increased in popularity lately. You can 
          usually find one or two on any subject if you search awhile on the net. 
          Some advantages of the Zines are the ability to publish news, changes 
          and updates immediately without the delay time of the magazines having 
          to go to the printer. A few of these will even e-mail a notice of the 
          changes to readers who sign up for a "Newsflash". Another nice thing 
          about Zines is they are FREE. There are a several gambling Zines available 
          to you one the internet. The following is a few that I have found. While 
          not all of them are updated as timely as the others, they all are worth 
          taking a look at. Rolling Good Times is the premiere gambling Zine on 
          the internet.</P>
        <P> They were the first and in my opinion are the best. RGT defines itself 
          as the "Comprehensive online magazine for gaming enthusiasts..Hot tips, 
          news and advice to make you a better player" They accomplish this with 
          articles by such well known gambling authors as Larry Edell, Frank Scoblete, 
          Henry Tamburin and a host of others. You can sign up for the "News Flash" 
          and be contacted with the updates that happen weekly. The Gamemaster 
          is billed as the "Zine with an attitude for the man about town with 
          a focus and commitment on winning" Gamemaster delivers on this promise 
          with timely news stories and some solid articles about all the games. 
          You can find advice on anything from horse racing to Video Poker. Columnist 
          include Chuck Wenstein from Conjelco and Mark Pilarski and some excellent 
          advice from "The Gamemaster." An E-mail "News Flash" is also available 
          to those wishing to be notified of updates. Bettor's Luck offers a fine 
          variety of interesting articles for gamblers. News stories and gambling 
          advice columns are updated monthly. You can even find a humour feature 
          and your gambling "Horoscope".</P>
        <P> Some of this months articles discuss topics from Megabucks to Beginners 
          Baccarat. I think this is one of the up and coming zines. Gamblers Den 
          is also a newer entry to the gambling zines. You can find the a wide 
          range of articles and information concerning the gaming industry. I'm 
          not sure how often this one is updated. each one of these zines has 
          something of interest. take a few moments to check them out. for your 
          convenience you can access them from this site. just click on the news 
          <../../msub5.htm>link on the right side of the home page. </P>
